### Face Mask Detection with OpenCV and Deep Learning
This project aims to detect whether individuals in real-time video streams are wearing face masks or not. It combines computer vision techniques, utilizing OpenCV, with deep learning methodologies, using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

## Features

1) Real-time face mask detection in video streams.
2) Preprocessing and augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.
3) CNN model architecture implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.
4) Training and evaluation on a labeled dataset.
5) Real-time visualization with bounding boxes and class labels.

## Dependencies

1) Python 3.x
2) OpenCV
3) TensorFlow
4) Keras
